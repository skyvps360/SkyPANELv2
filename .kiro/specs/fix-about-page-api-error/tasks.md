# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Update platform stats endpoint response structure

  - Modify the `/api/health/platform-stats` route handler in `api/routes/health.ts` to spread platform statistics directly into the response object instead of nesting under `stats` property
  - Maintain the `success` and `timestamp` metadata fields in the response
  - Keep error handling logic unchanged
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.3_

- [x] 2. Verify the fix resolves the About page errors


  - Start the development server and navigate to the `/about` page
  - Confirm that platform statistics load without console errors
  - Verify that all statistics display correctly in the "At a glance" card
  - Check browser console to ensure no "Internal server error" messages appear
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 1.4_

- [ ]\* 3. Verify VPS endpoints remain unaffected




  - Test VPS creation endpoint (`POST /api/vps`) to ensure response structure is unchanged
  - Test VPS listing endpoint (`GET /api/vps`) to ensure response structure is unchanged
  - Confirm VPS management operations (start, stop, reboot) work as before
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.5, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_


- [ ]\* 4. Verify caching behavior
  - Load the About page and note the cache expiry timestamp
  - Reload the page within 5 minutes and confirm the same timestamp is returned (cached data)
  - Wait 5+ minutes and reload to confirm a new timestamp is generated (cache refresh)
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_
