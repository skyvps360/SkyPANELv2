# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing admin user management page (`/admin#user-management`) to provide comprehensive user management capabilities. Currently, the page only displays users in a table format. This enhancement will add interactive user management actions including viewing user details, editing user information, and allowing administrators to impersonate users while maintaining their admin session.
