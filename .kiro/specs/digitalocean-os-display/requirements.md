# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature ensures that all DigitalOcean operating system images are properly fetched and displayed to users when creating a VPS instance. Currently, the system may not be displaying all available operating systems from the DigitalOcean API, limiting user choice during VPS provisioning.

## Glossary

- **DigitalOcean API**: The RESTful API provided by DigitalOcean for managing cloud resources
- **OS Image**: An operating system distribution image available for VPS deployment
- **Distribution**: The base operating system family (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, Rocky Linux, Fedora, Alpine, Arch Linux)
- **Image Type**: Classification of images as 'distribution' (base OS), 'application' (pre-configured apps), or 'custom' (user-uploaded)
- **VPS Creation Flow**: The multi-step wizard interface for provisioning a new VPS instance
- **DigitalOceanOSSelection Component**: The React component that displays available operating systems
- **DigitalOceanService**: The backend service that interfaces with the DigitalOcean API

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user creating a DigitalOcean VPS, I want to see all available operating system distributions, so that I can choose the OS that best fits my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the Operating System step in the VPS creation flow, THE DigitalOceanOSSelection Component SHALL fetch all distribution-type images from the DigitalOcean API
2. WHEN the DigitalOcean API returns image data, THE DigitalOceanOSSelection Component SHALL display all images without filtering or limiting the results
3. THE DigitalOceanService SHALL request images with appropriate pagination parameters to ensure all available images are retrieved
4. THE DigitalOceanOSSelection Component SHALL group displayed images by their distribution family for organized presentation
5. WHEN multiple pages of images exist in the API response, THE DigitalOceanService SHALL retrieve all pages of results

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see operating systems organized by distribution family, so that I can quickly find the OS type I'm looking for.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE DigitalOceanOSSelection Component SHALL group images by the 'distribution' field returned from the API
2. THE DigitalOceanOSSelection Component SHALL display distribution groups in alphabetical order
3. WITHIN each distribution group, THE DigitalOceanOSSelection Component SHALL sort images by name in ascending order
4. THE DigitalOceanOSSelection Component SHALL display a visual indicator (icon with distribution initials) for each distribution family
5. THE DigitalOceanOSSelection Component SHALL apply consistent color coding to distribution families for visual recognition

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search and filter operating systems, so that I can quickly find a specific OS version.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE DigitalOceanOSSelection Component SHALL provide a search input field that filters images in real-time
2. WHEN the user enters a search term, THE DigitalOceanOSSelection Component SHALL filter images by name, distribution, slug, or description
3. THE DigitalOceanOSSelection Component SHALL display a "No operating systems found" message when search results are empty
4. WHEN marketplace app compatibility is specified, THE DigitalOceanOSSelection Component SHALL filter images to show only compatible operating systems
5. THE DigitalOceanOSSelection Component SHALL provide a clear search button when no results are found

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to handle API pagination correctly, so that all available images are retrieved regardless of API response limits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE DigitalOceanService SHALL check for pagination metadata in API responses
2. WHEN the API response includes a 'next' link in pagination metadata, THE DigitalOceanService SHALL fetch the next page of results
3. THE DigitalOceanService SHALL continue fetching pages until no 'next' link is present
4. THE DigitalOceanService SHALL aggregate all pages of results into a single array before returning to the caller
5. THE DigitalOceanService SHALL handle pagination errors gracefully and return partial results with a warning

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see clear error messages when operating systems cannot be loaded, so that I understand what went wrong and can take corrective action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the DigitalOcean API returns an error, THE DigitalOceanOSSelection Component SHALL display a user-friendly error message
2. THE DigitalOceanOSSelection Component SHALL provide a retry button when an error occurs
3. WHEN the DigitalOcean provider is not configured, THE system SHALL return a 503 status code with a descriptive error message
4. THE DigitalOceanService SHALL log detailed error information for debugging purposes
5. THE DigitalOceanOSSelection Component SHALL display a loading indicator while fetching images

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to respect DigitalOcean API rate limits, so that the application doesn't get throttled or blocked.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE DigitalOceanService SHALL track request timestamps to monitor rate limit usage
2. WHEN approaching rate limits, THE DigitalOceanService SHALL implement exponential backoff for retries
3. WHEN the API returns a 429 rate limit error, THE DigitalOceanService SHALL respect the 'retry-after' header
4. THE DigitalOceanService SHALL limit concurrent image requests to prevent rate limit violations
5. THE DigitalOceanService SHALL cache image results for a reasonable duration to reduce API calls
