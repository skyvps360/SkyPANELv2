# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The VPS creation functionality on the `/vps` page currently uses a popup/modal interface that is not optimized for mobile devices, making it difficult or impossible for users to create VPS instances on mobile devices. This feature improvement will ensure the VPS creation flow is fully responsive and provides an excellent user experience across all device sizes, particularly on mobile phones and tablets.

## Glossary

- **VPS Creation Flow**: The user interface and process for creating new Virtual Private Server instances
- **Mobile Device**: Devices with screen widths typically below 768px (phones and small tablets)
- **Responsive Design**: UI that adapts and functions well across different screen sizes and orientations
- **Modal/Popup**: Overlay dialog component used for the current VPS creation form
- **ContainerStacks Platform**: The cloud service reseller billing panel application
