# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables administrators to manage FAQ content through a dedicated admin interface instead of modifying code files directly. The system will provide a user-friendly interface for creating, editing, reordering, and organizing FAQ categories and content, as well as managing the "Latest Updates" section. All changes will be persisted in the PostgreSQL database and dynamically rendered on the public FAQ page.
