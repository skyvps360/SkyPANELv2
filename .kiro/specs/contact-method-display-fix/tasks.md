# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create diagnostic scripts to identify the root cause

  - Create `scripts/diagnose-contact-methods.js` to test database connectivity and data presence
  - Create `scripts/test-contact-api-endpoints.js` to test admin and public API endpoints
  - Create `scripts/verify-contact-data-flow.js` to test complete admin â†’ public workflow
  - Add logging to identify where data flow breaks
  - Test with sample contact method data for each type (email, phone, ticket, office)
  - Document findings and identify the exact point of failure
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 2.3, 4.4, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3_

- [x] 2. Verify database schema and seed data integrity

  - Check contact_methods table exists with correct structure
  - Verify JSONB config field can store and retrieve complex data
  - Test database triggers for updated_at timestamps
  - Verify indexes are created and functional
  - Check if seed data was inserted correctly for all contact methods
  - Test direct database queries to ensure data persistence works
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.4, 6.1_

- [x] 3. Fix public API endpoint for contact configuration

  - Debug and fix the failing GET /api/contact/config endpoint
  - Verify database query syntax and connection handling

  - Ensure proper error handling and response formatting
  - Test response structure matches expected format for public Contact page
  - Verify JSONB config data is being deserialized correctly
  - Ensure all contact method types are included in response
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 4.2, 4.3, 4.5_

- [x] 4. Test and verify admin API endpoints for contact methods

  - Test PUT /api/admin/contact/methods/email endpoint with sample data
  - Test PUT /api/admin/contact/methods/phone endpoint with sample data
  - Test PUT /api/admin/contact/methods/ticket endpoint with sample data
  - Test PUT /api/admin/contact/methods/office endpoint with sample data
  - Verify JSONB config data is being serialized correctly on save
  - Fix any issues with data validation or persistence
  - Add comprehensive error logging for debugging
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 4.1, 4.3_

- [x] 5. Verify and fix admin interface data submission


  - Test ContactMethodManager component form submissions
  - Verify EmailMethodForm sends correct data structure
  - Verify PhoneMethodForm sends correct data structure
  - Verify TicketMethodForm sends correct data structure
  - Verify OfficeMethodForm sends correct data structure
  - Fix any issues with form data serialization or API calls
  - Verify categories work as expected and are selectable
  - Add better error handling and success feedback
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [x] 6. Test and fix public Contact page data processing

  - Verify Contact.tsx is calling the correct API endpoint
  - Test if contact methods are being fetched and displayed correctly

  - Fix and verify that categories are selectable as they do not show data
  - Test data processing logic for each contact method type
  - Check if active/inactive filtering is working on frontend
  - Verify fallback behavior when data is missing
  - Fix any issues with data rendering or display logic
  - Ensure visual consistency with original design
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5_
