# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses a critical bug in the admin contact management feature where contact method data (Email, Phone, Ticket, Office) saved through the admin interface at `/admin#contact-management` does not appear on the public Contact page at `/contact`. While the admin interface allows administrators to configure contact methods and shows success messages, the configured data is not being properly retrieved and displayed on the public-facing contact page. This bug prevents the core functionality of the contact management system from working as intended.

## Glossary

- **Contact_System**: The complete contact management feature including admin interface and public display
- **Admin_Contact_Interface**: The administrative interface at `/admin#contact-management` for managing contact methods
- **Public_Contact_Page**: The public-facing contact page at `/contact` that displays contact information to users
- **Contact_Method**: A way users can reach the team (Email, Phone, Ticket, Office) with specific configuration data
- **Contact_Method_Config**: The JSONB configuration data stored for each contact method type
- **Contact_API**: The backend API endpoints that handle contact method data operations
- **Data_Persistence**: The process of saving contact method data to the PostgreSQL database
- **Data_Retrieval**: The process of fetching contact method data from the database for display

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want contact method data saved in the admin interface to persist correctly to the database, so that the data is available for retrieval by the public contact page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator saves email contact method data, THE Contact_System SHALL persist the email address, title, description, response time, and is_active flag to the contact_methods table
2. WHEN an administrator saves phone contact method data, THE Contact_System SHALL persist the phone number, title, description, availability text, and is_active flag to the contact_methods table
3. WHEN an administrator saves ticket contact method data, THE Contact_System SHALL persist the title, description, dashboard link, priority queues array, and is_active flag to the contact_methods table
4. WHEN an administrator saves office contact method data, THE Contact_System SHALL persist the title, description, address fields, appointment text, and is_active flag to the contact_methods table
5. THE Contact_System SHALL validate that all contact method data is correctly stored in the database after each save operation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to verify that contact method data is being saved correctly, so that I can troubleshoot any data persistence issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator saves contact method data, THE Contact_System SHALL provide clear success feedback indicating the data was saved
2. WHEN a save operation fails, THE Contact_System SHALL display specific error messages indicating what went wrong
3. THE Contact_System SHALL log all contact method save operations for debugging purposes
4. THE Contact_System SHALL validate the structure of JSONB config data before saving to the database
5. THE Contact_System SHALL provide a way to verify saved data through database queries or admin interface display

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user visiting the contact page, I want to see the contact methods configured by administrators, so that I can reach the team through the available channels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the public contact page loads, THE Contact_System SHALL retrieve all active contact methods from the contact_methods table
2. WHEN contact method data exists in the database, THE Contact_System SHALL display the configured email method with correct email address, title, description, and response time
3. WHEN contact method data exists in the database, THE Contact_System SHALL display the configured phone method with correct phone number, title, description, and availability text
4. WHEN contact method data exists in the database, THE Contact_System SHALL display the configured ticket method with correct title, description, dashboard link, and priority queues
5. WHEN contact method data exists in the database, THE Contact_System SHALL display the configured office method with correct title, description, address, and appointment information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the contact API endpoints to correctly handle contact method data operations, so that the admin interface and public page can communicate properly with the database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Contact_API SHALL provide a PUT endpoint at `/api/admin/contact/methods/:method_type` that correctly updates contact method data in the database
2. THE Contact_API SHALL provide a GET endpoint at `/api/contact/config` that correctly retrieves all active contact method data from the database
3. THE Contact_API SHALL properly serialize and deserialize JSONB config data for each contact method type
4. THE Contact_API SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages for all contact method operations
5. THE Contact_API SHALL ensure that contact method data structure matches the expected format for both admin and public interfaces

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want real-time feedback when saving contact method data, so that I know immediately if changes were successful or if there are issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator clicks save on a contact method form, THE Contact_System SHALL show a loading state during the save operation
2. WHEN a save operation succeeds, THE Contact_System SHALL display a success toast notification with specific details about what was saved
3. WHEN a save operation fails, THE Contact_System SHALL display an error toast notification with actionable information about the failure
4. THE Contact_System SHALL update the admin interface immediately to reflect saved changes without requiring a page refresh
5. THE Contact_System SHALL provide visual indicators showing which contact methods are currently active and configured

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to diagnose and fix data flow issues between the admin interface and public display, so that the contact management feature works reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Contact_System SHALL provide database queries to verify contact method data is correctly stored
2. THE Contact_System SHALL provide API endpoint testing capabilities to verify data retrieval
3. THE Contact_System SHALL log all database operations related to contact methods for debugging
4. THE Contact_System SHALL validate data integrity between admin saves and public retrieval
5. THE Contact_System SHALL provide clear error messages when data flow issues are detected

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the contact page to gracefully handle missing or incomplete contact method data, so that I always see a functional contact page even if admin configuration is incomplete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN contact method data is missing from the database, THE Contact_System SHALL display appropriate fallback content on the public contact page
2. WHEN contact method data is partially configured, THE Contact_System SHALL display only the complete and valid contact methods
3. WHEN all contact methods are disabled, THE Contact_System SHALL display a message indicating how users can reach support
4. THE Contact_System SHALL never display broken or incomplete contact method cards on the public page
5. THE Contact_System SHALL maintain visual consistency even when some contact methods are missing or disabled

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to test the complete workflow from admin configuration to public display, so that I can verify the contact management feature is working end-to-end.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator configures a contact method and saves it, THE Contact_System SHALL immediately make that data available through the public API
2. WHEN an administrator refreshes the public contact page after making changes, THE Contact_System SHALL display the updated contact method information
3. WHEN an administrator disables a contact method, THE Contact_System SHALL immediately hide that method from the public contact page
4. THE Contact_System SHALL provide a way to test the complete data flow from admin interface to public display
5. THE Contact_System SHALL ensure that changes made in the admin interface are reflected on the public page within seconds
