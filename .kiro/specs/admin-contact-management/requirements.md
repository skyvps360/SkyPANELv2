# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables administrators to manage the Contact page content through a dedicated admin interface, similar to the existing FAQ management system. The system will provide a user-friendly interface for configuring contact categories, contact methods (Email, Ticket, Call, Office), availability schedules, and platform-wide settings. All changes will be persisted in the PostgreSQL database and dynamically rendered on the public Contact page. Additionally, this feature will reorganize admin settings by introducing a new "Platform" section that consolidates Theme, FAQ Management, and Contact Management under a unified settings area.
