# Real-Time Notification System Implementation

## Overview
Successfully transformed the activity system into a real-time notification system with seamless integration into the top navigation menu, positioned between the theme toggle and user avatar dropdown.

## Architecture

### Backend Components

#### 1. Database Schema (`migrations/008_notifications.sql`)
- **New Columns**: Added `is_read` (BOOLEAN) and `read_at` (TIMESTAMP) to `activity_logs` table
- **PostgreSQL Trigger**: Created `activity_notify_trigger` that automatically emits PostgreSQL NOTIFY events when new activities are inserted
- **Helper Functions**:
  - `mark_notification_read(notification_id, user_id)`: Mark a single notification as read
  - `mark_all_notifications_read(user_id)`: Mark all notifications as read for a user
- **Indexes**: Added index on `(user_id, is_read, created_at)` for efficient querying

#### 2. Notification Service (`api/services/notificationService.ts`)
- **PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY**: Listens to `new_activity` channel using a dedicated PostgreSQL client
- **Event Emitter**: Extends Node.js EventEmitter to broadcast notifications to SSE clients
- **Auto-Reconnect**: Implements exponential backoff reconnection strategy (up to 10 attempts)
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Properly handles SIGINT/SIGTERM signals
- **Singleton Pattern**: Single instance manages all real-time connections

#### 3. Notifications API Routes (`api/routes/notifications.ts`)
**Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/notifications/stream` - Server-Sent Events endpoint for real-time updates
  - Custom authentication via query parameter (EventSource limitation)
  - Heartbeat every 30 seconds to keep connection alive
  - Filters notifications by user_id
  
- `GET /api/notifications/unread-count` - Get count of unread notifications
- `GET /api/notifications/unread` - Get list of unread notifications (limit: 20)
- `GET /api/notifications` - Get all notifications with pagination
- `PATCH /api/notifications/:id/read` - Mark specific notification as read
- `PATCH /api/notifications/read-all` - Mark all user's notifications as read

#### 4. Application Setup (`api/app.ts`)
- Registered notifications router at `/api/notifications`
- Started notification service on app initialization
- Service starts automatically when API server starts

### Frontend Components

#### 1. NotificationDropdown Component (`src/components/NotificationDropdown.tsx`)
**Features**:
- **Bell Icon**: Displays in navigation with animated badge showing unread count
- **Real-time Updates**: Establishes SSE connection to receive live notifications
- **Dropdown UI**: 
  - Header with "Mark all as read" button
  - Scrollable notification list (max height: 80vh)
  - Status-based color coding (success/error/warning/info)
  - Relative timestamps ("just now", "5m ago", etc.)
  - Visual distinction for unread items (blue background)
  - Individual "mark as read" buttons
- **Toast Notifications**: Shows brief popup when new notifications arrive
- **Click Outside to Close**: Dropdown closes when clicking anywhere outside
- **Responsive**: Works on both desktop and mobile layouts

#### 2. Navigation Integration (`src/components/Navigation.tsx`)
- Added NotificationDropdown between theme toggle and user menu (as requested)
- Integrated in both desktop and mobile header layouts
- Maintains consistent styling with existing UI components

## Data Flow

1. **Activity Creation**:
   - Any activity logged via `logActivity()` is inserted into `activity_logs`
   - PostgreSQL trigger fires and emits NOTIFY event with notification data

2. **Real-time Broadcast**:
   - Notification service (listening on PostgreSQL channel) receives the event
   - Event is broadcasted to all connected SSE clients via EventEmitter

3. **Client Reception**:
   - NotificationDropdown component receives SSE message
   - Updates local state (adds to notification list, increments unread count)
   - Shows toast notification to user
   - Badge animates with pulse effect

4. **User Interaction**:
   - User clicks bell icon to open dropdown
   - Can mark individual notifications as read
   - Can mark all notifications as read
   - Can view full activity history by clicking footer link

## Key Technical Decisions

### PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY
- **Why**: Native PostgreSQL feature for real-time pub/sub
- **Benefits**: 
  - No external message broker needed
  - Guaranteed delivery within PostgreSQL
  - Lightweight and fast
  - Works with existing database connection

### Server-Sent Events (SSE) over WebSocket
- **Why**: One-way communication (server → client) is sufficient
- **Benefits**:
  - Simpler than WebSocket
  - Automatic reconnection built-in
  - HTTP/2 compatible
  - Less overhead
- **Limitation**: EventSource can't send custom headers
- **Solution**: Token passed as query parameter for authentication

### Trigger-based Notifications
- **Why**: Automatic, consistent, no code changes needed for new activities
- **Benefits**:
  - Every activity automatically becomes a notification
  - Zero risk of missing notifications
  - Centralized logic in database
  - Performance optimized by PostgreSQL

## Styling & UX

- **Consistent Design**: Uses existing Tailwind classes and dark mode support
- **Visual Indicators**:
  - Red badge with pulse animation for unread count
  - Blue background for unread notifications
  - Color-coded status (green=success, red=error, yellow=warning, blue=info)
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation support
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works seamlessly on all screen sizes

## Testing the System

To test the notification system:

1. **Start the development server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Log in** to the application
3. **Observe** the notification bell in the top right navigation
4. **Trigger activities** by:
   - Creating a VPS instance
   - Creating a container
   - Any other action that logs activity
5. **Watch** for:
   - Real-time badge count update
   - Toast notification popup
   - New notification appearing in dropdown
6. **Test interactions**:
   - Click individual "mark as read" buttons
   - Click "mark all as read" button
   - Verify badge count updates

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Notification preferences (enable/disable certain types)
- Email notifications for important events
- Notification sound/desktop notifications
- Notification grouping by type
- Configurable notification retention period
- Read receipts and delivery confirmation
- Advanced filtering and search

## Files Modified/Created

### Created:
- `migrations/008_notifications.sql`
- `api/services/notificationService.ts`
- `api/routes/notifications.ts`
- `src/components/NotificationDropdown.tsx`

### Modified:
- `api/app.ts` - Added notifications router and started notification service
- `src/components/Navigation.tsx` - Integrated NotificationDropdown component

## Performance Considerations

- **SSE Connection**: One persistent connection per logged-in user
- **Database**: Indexed queries for fast unread notification fetching
- **Memory**: Notifications limited to 20 recent items in frontend state
- **Heartbeat**: 30-second interval prevents connection timeout
- **Auto-cleanup**: SSE connections properly closed on disconnect

## Security

- **Authentication**: Token-based auth with JWT validation
- **Authorization**: Users only receive their own notifications
- **SQL Injection**: All queries use parameterized statements
- **XSS Protection**: React automatically escapes content
- **Token Exposure**: Query param used only for SSE (necessary limitation)

---

**Status**: ✅ Complete and ready for testing
**PostgreSQL**: ✅ Using native PostgreSQL features (LISTEN/NOTIFY)
**UI Integration**: ✅ Positioned between theme toggle and user menu
**Real-time**: ✅ Immediate updates without page refresh
