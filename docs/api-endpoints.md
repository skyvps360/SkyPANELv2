# API Reference

All API endpoints are served from the Express application under `/api`. Unless noted, request and response bodies are JSON. Authentication uses bearer JWT tokens returned by `/api/auth/login` or `/api/auth/register`.

## Rate Limiting

ContainerStacks implements intelligent rate limiting to prevent abuse while maintaining optimal user experience. Rate limits are applied based on user authentication status and role.

### Rate Limit Tiers

| User Type | Requests per 15 minutes | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Anonymous** | 200 | Public endpoints, login, registration |
| **Authenticated** | 500 | Normal application usage with JWT token |
| **Admin** | 1000 | Administrative operations and bulk actions |

### Rate Limit Headers

All API responses include rate limiting information in headers:

```http
X-RateLimit-Limit: 500          # Maximum requests allowed in window
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 487      # Requests remaining in current window
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1640995200   # Unix timestamp when window resets
X-RateLimit-Used: 13            # Requests used in current window
```

### Rate Limit Exceeded Response

When rate limits are exceeded, the API returns HTTP 429 with retry information:

```json
{
  "error": "Too many requests. Please try again later.",
  "retryAfter": 847,              // Seconds until window resets
  "limit": 500,                   // Current rate limit
  "remaining": 0,                 // Requests remaining (always 0)
  "resetTime": 1640995200,        // Unix timestamp when window resets
  "userType": "authenticated"     // User classification for this request
}
```

### Rate Limiting Best Practices

**For Client Applications:**
- Monitor rate limit headers to avoid hitting limits
- Implement exponential backoff when receiving 429 responses
- Cache responses when possible to reduce API calls
- Use WebSocket connections for real-time features instead of polling

**For Authenticated Users:**
- Login to access higher rate limits (500 vs 200 requests)
- Batch operations when possible to reduce API calls
- Consider the 15-minute window when planning bulk operations

**For Administrators:**
- Admin accounts have the highest limits (1000 requests per 15 minutes)
- Use admin endpoints efficiently for bulk operations
- Monitor rate limiting metrics in the admin dashboard

### IP Detection and Proxy Support

Rate limiting uses accurate IP detection that works behind proxies:
- Supports X-Forwarded-For headers from trusted proxies
- Works correctly behind Vite development server
- Handles multiple proxy hops (Cloudflare, nginx, etc.)
- Falls back to socket remote address when proxy headers unavailable
