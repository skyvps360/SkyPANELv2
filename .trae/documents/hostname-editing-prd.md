# VPS Hostname Editing Feature - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Overview

This feature enables users to edit VPS hostname directly from the VPS detail page with real-time updates via Linode's official API. Users can modify the hostname inline, providing immediate feedback and seamless integration with the existing ContainerStacks platform.

The feature addresses the need for quick hostname management without navigating to external provider interfaces, enhancing user experience and operational efficiency for VPS management workflows.
