Static backgrounds feel flat. Lifeless. Like a printed poster stuck to the wall. What if your background could float, breathe, suggest movement and depth? This React component creates 36 SVG paths that drift through space like abstract brushstrokes, with text that animates letter by letter and glassmorphism effects that feel premium.

### Floating path animations

Watch abstract SVG paths drift with synchronized opacity and elegant text animations:

<Preview path="background/background-paths" />

Built for React applications with TypeScript and Next.js. Uses Framer Motion for smooth path animations with staggered timing. Each path floats independently with opacity cycling that creates depth. Letter-by-letter text animation with spring effects adds sophistication. Perfect for landing pages, portfolios, or any design that needs to feel artistic and alive.

## Installation

<Installer packageName="background-paths" />

## Usage

```tsx
import { BackgroundPaths } from "@/components/ui/background-paths";

export default function ArtisticLanding() {
  return (
    <div className="relative h-screen w-full">
      <BackgroundPaths title="Creative Studio" />
      {/* The component includes its own content overlay with title and button */}
      {/* Additional content can be layered with higher z-index if needed */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Why most floating animations look cheap

Most developers use CSS keyframes with basic transforms. Paths move in perfect circles or straight linesâ€”obviously programmed, predictably robotic. Others try JavaScript with `setInterval` for random movement, but it's janky and inconsistent. Some use particle libraries, but they render thousands of identical dots instead of unique artistic shapes.

This React component uses 36 unique SVG path definitions that create abstract, organic shapes. Framer Motion handles the animation with spring physics and staggered timing. Each path floats with independent opacity cycling, creating natural depth layers. The letter-by-letter text animation uses proper easing curves, not linear movement. It's the difference between digital art and a screensaver.

## Features

* **36 unique SVG paths** floating with independent timing and opacity cycles
* **Framer Motion animations** providing spring physics and smooth interpolation
* **Letter-by-letter text animation** with staggered timing and spring effects
* **Interactive glassmorphism button** with hover states and micro-interactions
* **Automatic dark mode adaptation** with theme-aware colors and gradients
* **Responsive text scaling** maintaining readability across all screen sizes
* **Accessibility optimized** respecting motion preferences and screen readers
* **TypeScript definitions** for all animation and customization parameters
* **Performance optimized** using hardware-accelerated transforms
* **shadcn/ui compatible** with proper theming and design system integration

## API Reference

### BackgroundPaths

Main component for floating SVG path animations with integrated text and UI elements.

| Prop    | Type     | Default              | Description                               |
| ------- | -------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `title` | `string` | `"Background Paths"` | Title text for letter-by-letter animation |

**Note**: This component includes built-in content (title, button, full-screen layout) and is designed as a complete hero section rather than a background-only component.

### Animation Details

Each floating path uses carefully orchestrated Framer Motion animations:

```tsx
// Path floating animation
animations: {
  y: [-20, 20, -20], // Vertical floating
  opacity: [0.1, 0.8, 0.1], // Synchronized opacity cycling
  transition: {
    duration: 8-15s, // Variable timing per path
    repeat: Infinity,
    ease: "easeInOut"
  }
}

// Text letter animation
letter: {
  initial: { opacity: 0, y: 50 },
  animate: { opacity: 1, y: 0 },
  transition: {
    type: "spring",
    stiffness: 100,
    delay: index * 0.1 // Staggered timing
  }
}
```

### SVG Path Design

The 36 paths use diverse bezier curves and shapes:

* Abstract organic curves and flowing lines
* Varied stroke widths and path lengths
* Strategic positioning across the viewport
* Optimized SVG code for performance

## Common gotchas

**Performance with motion sensitivity**: The component has many animated elements. Users with `prefers-reduced-motion` should see static versions. Consider adding motion preference detection.

**Fixed content structure**: Unlike other background components, this includes built-in UI elements (title, button, layout). It's designed as a complete hero section, not just a background.

**Framer Motion dependency**: Requires Framer Motion as a peer dependency. If your project doesn't use it elsewhere, this adds bundle size. Consider simpler alternatives for basic floating effects.

**Z-index layering complexity**: The component manages its own layering with multiple elements. Adding custom content requires careful z-index planning to avoid conflicts.

**Dark mode path visibility**: SVG paths adapt to theme colors. In some custom themes, paths might become too faint or too bold. Test across all theme variations.

**Text length limitations**: Very long titles might break the letter-by-letter animation layout. Consider truncating or wrapping for extremely long text.

## Questions developers actually ask

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion id="custom-paths" title="Can I customize the SVG paths or add my own shapes?">
    The 36 paths are hardcoded in the component. To customize them, you'd need to modify the SVG path definitions in the component code. Each path has a unique `d` attribute defining its shape.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion id="background-only" title="Can I use this as a background-only component without the UI elements?">
    This component includes built-in title and button elements. For background-only floating paths, you'd need to extract just the path animation logic into a separate component.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion id="animation-speed" title="How do I change the floating animation speed?">
    Animation duration and timing are defined in the Framer Motion configurations. To modify speed, you'd need to adjust the `duration` values in the component's animation objects.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion id="path-colors" title="Can I change the colors of the floating paths?">
    Path colors are controlled by CSS variables and Tailwind classes. You can override them with custom CSS or by modifying the component's styling classes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion id="mobile-performance" title="Does this work well on mobile devices?">
    The component uses hardware-accelerated transforms and is optimized for mobile. However, 36 animated elements might impact battery life. Consider reducing animation complexity for mobile.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion id="accessibility-motion" title="How does this handle users who prefer reduced motion?">
    The component should respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media queries. If it doesn't, consider wrapping animations in motion preference checks or providing a static fallback.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>
